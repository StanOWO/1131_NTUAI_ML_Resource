1. **HappyML**
   - [**HappyML**](https://github.com/cnchi/HappyML) is a ML library created by [**cnchi**](https://github.com/cnchi).
   - designed to reduce the time spent writing ML programs.
   - To avoid setting the Environment variable, I put HappyML in every folders

2. **Linear_Regression.py**
    - A program to demonstrate Linear Regression without HappyML
    - The dataset is from [**Salary Data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mastmustu/income)
3. **Linear_Regression_happy.py**
    - A program to demonstrate Linear Regression with HappyML
    - The dataset is from [**Salary Data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mastmustu/income)
4. **Logistic_Regression.py**
   - A program to demonstrate Logistic Regression
   - The dataset is from [**car_data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/cars-purchase-decision-dataset)
5. **K_means.py**
   - A program to demonstrate K_means Clustering and output group.csv which is a file with dataset and answer
   - The dataset is from [**Hobby_Data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsadiq/salary)
6. **Linear_Regression_hw.py**
   - A program to practice Linear Regression
   - The dataset is from [**Salary.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsadiq/salary)
7. **Logistic_Regression_hw.py**
   - A program to practice Logistic Regression
   - The dataset is from [**Social_Network_Ads.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/d4rklucif3r/social-network-ads)
8. **K_means_hw.py**
   - A program to practice K_means Clustering and output group.csv which is a file with dataset and answer
   - The dataset is from [**Family Income and Expenditure.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure)
9. **California_Housing_Price_hw.py**
   - A program to show Multiclass Classification by using SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest
   - The dataset is from [**housing.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
