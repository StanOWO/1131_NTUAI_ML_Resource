1. **HappyML**
- [**HappyML**](https://github.com/cnchi/HappyML) is a ML library created by [**cnchi**](https://github.com/cnchi).
- designed to reduce the time spent writing ML programs.
- To avoid setting Environment, I put HappyML in every folders

2. **Linear_Regression.py**
- A program to demonstrate Linear Regression without HappyML
- datasets from [**Salary Data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mastmustu/income)
3. **Linear_Regression_happy.py**
- A program to demonstrate Linear Regression with HappyML
- datasets from [**Salary.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsadiq/salary)
4. **Logistic_Regression.py**
- A program to demonstrate Logistic Regression
- datasets from [**car_data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/cars-purchase-decision-dataset)
5. **K_means.py**
- A program to demonstrate K_means Clustering
- datasets from [**Hobby_Data.csv**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsadiq/salary)
